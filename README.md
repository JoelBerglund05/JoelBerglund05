## Student

I'm a IT student at TC Stenungsund in sweden. At the moment I'm building a recipe/socialmedia app as a PWA. I'm using Laravel as back-end with inertia for my vue front-end.
The hardest part of the project is the UX/UI, mostly because there's a lot of components needed to make the functionality great meanwhile it shouldn't feel cluttered. 

* 🌍  I'm based in sweden.
*  ✉️  You can contact me at [Joelberglund4497@gmail.com](mailto:Joelberglund4497@gmail.com).
*  🧠  I'm learning Laravel, HTML, CSS and Vue.
